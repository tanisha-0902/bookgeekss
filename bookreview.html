   <h3>The Psychology of Money</h3>
   
   <p> <b>Morgan Houseln</b>
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>Rating: ★★★☆☆</b>
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>Review: In a world brimming with financial advice, Morgan Housel's "The Psychology of Money" stands out as a beacon of clarity and wisdom. It's not a book about investment strategies or complex financial models; it's a profound exploration of the human mind and its intricate relationship with money.
</b>
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>Description: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money isn?t necessarily about what you know. It?s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do.</b></p>

<h3>The Kalki Trilogy Avatar of Vishnu; Eye of Brahma; Sword of Shiva</h3>

<p> <b>Author:Kevin Missal</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Rating: ★★★★☆</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Review: Storyline - Started off fine but went on to become boring very soon. There was too much built up done in part 1 and it didn't end in a good or satisfying core story. The climax was very disappointing, very poor and inefficient utilization of the huge number of magnificent characters that were at writer's disposal.
</b>
<br>
<br><b>Description:Kevin has written down a beautiful novel, a retelling of the avatar of Lord Vishnu, Kalki, in a not so “mythological” manner. He has immense strength, which has been proven time and again by events like defeating enemies twice his size, faster healing of wounds and very sharp fighting skills. He doesn’t have a decent explanation about the skills he possesses until he meets Kripa aka Kripacharya—a guru who had been a part of the biggest battle against evil—the Mahayudh.</b></p>
